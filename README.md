## Features
#### Text-to-speech library implementation
#### Order of operations
- (1 + 3 / 4 + 10 * 2) yields 21.75
#### Successive operations
- (1 + 1 + 2 =) yields 4
#### Operation Repeat 
- (1 + 1 = = =) yields 4
#### Changing operation keys
- (1 + - * 2 =) yields 2

Feature Name | Input | Result  
---|---| ---
**Order of operations** | 1 + 3 / 4 + 10 * 2| 21.75 |
**Partial operand**| 3 * =	| 9
**Missing operation**| 3 =	| 3
**Successive operations**      | 1 + 1 + 2 =      |   4 |
**Changing operation keys** | 1 + - * 2 =      |    4 |
**Operation rollover** | 1 + 1 + = + = | 8|
**Operation repeat** | 1 + 1 = = =	| 4
**Multiple operation keys**|  1 ++++ 2 =| 3




## Planned Additions
- ASCII key inputs.

## What I've Learned
- How to approach seemingly complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more-managable pieces.
